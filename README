TODO:

1. Add exception handling for cases such as
    - Invalid csv format columns which can't be transformed to JSON
    - Invalid file input
    
2. Add more unit tests for each class and then integration tests to test the interaction between the classes

3. Improve the UI to allow the user to specify source and select conversion goal

4. Since there is the ILinesReader interface a database lines reader could be implemented and injected easily
